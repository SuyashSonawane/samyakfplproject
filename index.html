                <h3><u>Sand:</u></h3>
                <p>
                    Sand is used with cement, and sometimes lime, to make mortar for masonry work and plaster. Sand is also used as a part of the concrete mix. 
                    An important low-cost building material in countries with high sand content soils is the Sandcrete block, which is weaker but cheaper than fired clay bricks.

    <h3><u>Stone or rock:</u></h3>
    <p>Rock structures have existed for as long as history can recall. It is the longest lasting building material available, and is usually readily available.
        There are many types of rock throughout the world, all with differing attributes that make them better or worse for particular uses. 
        Rock is a very dense material so it gives a lot of protection too; its main drawback as a material is its weight and awkwardness. 
        Its energy density is also considered a big drawback, as stone is hard to keep warm without using large amounts of heating resources.

        Dry-stone walls have been built for as long as humans have put one stone on top of another. 
        Eventually, different forms of mortar were used to hold the stones together, cement being the most commonplace now.
        
        The granite-strewn uplands of Dartmoor National Park, United Kingdom, for example, provided ample resources for early settlers. 
        Circular huts were constructed from loose granite rocks throughout the Neolithic and early Bronze Age, 
        and the remains of an estimated 5,000 can still be seen today.
         Granite continued to be used throughout the Medieval period (see Dartmoor longhouse) and into modern times. 
         Slate is another stone type </p>

            <h3><u>Bricks:</u></h3>
            <p>A brick is building material used to make walls, pavements and other elements in masonry construction.
                Traditionally, the term brick referred to a unit composed of clay, but it is now used to denote any rectangular units laid in mortar. 
                A brick can be composed of clay-bearing soil, sand, and lime, or concrete materials. Bricks are produced in numerous classes, types, materials, 
                and sizes which vary with region and time period, and are produced in bulk quantities. 
                Two basic categories of bricks are fired and non-fired bricks.In India, standard brick size is 190 mm x 90 mm x 90 mm as per the recommendation of BIS. With mortar thickness, the dimension of the brick becomes 200 mm x 100 mm x 100 mm which is also known as the nominal size of the modular brick</p>

             <h3><U>Stone Aggrigate:</U></h3>
            <p>Crushed stone is one of the most accessible natural resources, and is a major basic raw material used by construction, agriculture, and other industries.
                Despite the low value of its basic products, the crushed stone industry is a major contributor to and 
                an indicator of the economic well-being of a nation. 
                The demand for crushed stone is determined mostly by the level of construction activity, and, therefore, the demand for construction materials.</p>

            <h3><u>Cement:</u></h3>
            <p>
                    A cement is a binder, a substance used for construction that sets, hardens, and adheres to other materials to bind them together.
                     Cement is seldom used on its own, but rather to bind sand and gravel (aggregate) together. Cement mixed with fine aggregate produces mortar for masonry,
                      or with sand and gravel, produces concrete. 
                    Cement is the most widely used material in existence and is only behind water as the planet's most-consumed resource.

            <h3><u>Cement Mortar:</u></h3>
            <p>
                    Quantity of cement mortar is required for rate analysis of brickwork and plaster or estimation of masonry work for a building or structure. 
                    Cement mortar is used in various proportions, i.e. 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:6, 1:8 etc.

            <h3><u>Cement Concrete:</u></h3>
            <p>
                    A concrete mixer (often colloquially called a cement mixer) is a device that homogeneously combines cement, aggregate such as sand or gravel,
                     and water to form concrete. A typical concrete mixer uses a revolving drum to mix the components. For smaller volume works, 
                     portable concrete mixers are often used so that the concrete can be made at the construction site,
                     giving the workers ample time to use the concrete before it hardens. An alternative to a machine is mixing concrete by hand.

            <h3><u>Foundation:</u></h3>
            <p>
                    Foundation in construction. A foundation is a lower portion of building structure that transfers its gravity loads to the earth.
                     Foundations are generally broken into two categories: shallow foundations and deep foundations

            <h3><u>Super Structure:</U></h3>
            <p>
                    Super-structure is that part of the structure which is above ground level, and which serves the purpose of its intended use.
                     A part of the super-structure, located between the ground level and (he floor level is known as plinth.

            <h3><u>Safety & Health Standards:</u></h3>
            <p>
                    Civil engineering is a field with many safety and health risks, making it imperative that each employee is protected against any possible hazards.
                     By using the above programs and tools, civil engineers can design and build each project under much safer conditions.
